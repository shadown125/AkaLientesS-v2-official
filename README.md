Welcome to AkaLientesS Project which is my Portfolio Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The Website can be found under: https://www.akalientess.com/

The Vue.js (with nuxt.js hybrid Framework) is available under: [`Vue-AkaLientesS-v2`](https://github.com/shadown125/AkaLientesS-v2)

The First version of my Portfolio website build with Hugo and native JS can be found under: [`AkaLientesS`](https://github.com/shadown125/Akalientess)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Styles are under `src/styles` folder. Styles are written in Dart Sass and every folder represents module which is styled.
If you want to change styles you need to run Sass watcher:

```bash
npm run watch
```
For Production, you need to run the build script for styles:
```bash
npm run style:build
```
